\begin{theorem}
  \label{diag_iff_D}
  An algebraic group $G$ is diagonalizable
  if and only if it is isomorphic to $D(M)$ for some commutative group $M$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{congr_fggrp_diag}
  \uses{char_lattice}
  The functor $M\rightsquigarrow D(M)$ is a contravariant equivalence
  from the category of finitely generated commutative groups to the category of
  diagonalizable algebraic groups (with quasi-inverse $G \rightsquigarrow X(G)$).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{diag_iff_D}
  See Theorem 12.9(a) in \cite{Milne_2017}.
\end{proof}
