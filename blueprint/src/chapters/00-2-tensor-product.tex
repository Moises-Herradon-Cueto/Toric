  If $f$ and $g$ are linearly independent families of points in semimodules $M$ and $N$, then $i j \mapsto f i \ox g j$ is a linearly independent family of points in $M \ox N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

  Assume
  \[
    \sum_{i, j} c_{i, j} f i \ox g j = \sum_{i, j} d_{i, j} f i \ox g j
  \]
  Then
  \[
    \sum_i f i \ox \left(\sum_j c_{i, j} g j\right) = \sum_i f i \ox \left(\sum_j d_{i, j} g j\right)
  \]
  Since $f$ is linearly independent,
  \[
    \sum_j c_{i, j} g j = \sum_j d_{i, j} g j
  \]
  for every $i$. Since $g$ is linearly independent, $c_{i, j} = d_{i, j}$ for all $i, j$, as wanted.
\end{proof}
